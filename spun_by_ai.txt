Here's a rewritten version of Chapter 1 in simpler, modern English:

**The Gates of Morning**

**Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder**

DICK stood on the edge of a coral ledge, gazing out at the South Sea. Behind him, the waves crashed and spindrift scattered in the wind; before him, the calm waters of Karolin lagoon stretched out like an endless blue lake. Women, children, and young people were busy along the beach, fishing, playing games, or working on their canoes.

All these people belonged to Dick's tribe, his own people. He had landed here just yesterday. The canoes were drawn up on the sand, and the empty houses where the war canoes once rested stood like skeletons.

As he scanned the lagoon, Dick's brow furrowed in concern. His eyes turned away from the water and focused on the breakers on the outer beach and the northern sea. Beyond the horizon, beyond what was visible, lay Palm Tree Island, a place shrouded in myth and danger.

Little Tari, son of Le Taioi, the net maker, looked up at Dick with curiosity. He knew nothing about life, but he knew that when the war came, his people had been left defenseless without men or leaders to protect them. Yesterday, from the northern sea in a strange boat, this new figure had arrived, sent by the gods so the women said, to be their chief and ruler.

Tari's eyes locked onto Dick's face as he asked directly, "Who are you?"

Dick hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. He knew that Tari was still young, and his words might not make sense to him. In a way, Dick felt like a stranger in this new world, one where everything was foreign and unfamiliar.

"I come from people beyond your world," Dick began slowly. "My name is Dick Lestrange. When I was a boy, just like you, I lived on an island called Marua with an old sailor man named Kearney. He taught me how to fish and build little ships. But then one day, Katafa arrived, a girl from here who had been blown away by a storm. We lived together till... till Kearney died."

Dick's voice trailed off, lost in thought. As he spoke, his mind wandered back to the schooner that had brought him and Katafa to this island, and the horror of what happened when they arrived.

But he couldn't reveal all the truth to Tari. Some memories were still shrouded in mist, like the tropical sun that bathed Marua Island. All Dick knew was that Kearney had made him those little ships, and that Katafa had taught him her language.

As Dick gazed out at the lagoon, his thoughts turned back to Palm Tree Island and the danger it posed. He saw again the horde of savages on the beach, their monstrous faces like something from a nightmare. The memory of their violence and hatred filled him with a dark rage.

Dick's eyes narrowed as he watched the canoe builders approaching the lagoon. They were sent by him to gather the experts who would build war canoes to defend against potential invaders. But Dick's mind was elsewhere, consumed by his passion for Katafa and the threat she posed to him.

As they walked along the beach, Katafa pointed out to sea, her eyes fixed on something that only she could see. "Look!" she said softly.

Behind them, Palm Tree Island began to take shape, its outline visible in the southern sky like a mirage. The vision was fleeting, but it filled Dick with a sense of foreboding. He knew that the island's beauty was a threat, and that he would have to protect his people from those who sought to harm them.

As they turned to face the lagoon, Katafa pointed across the water at a canoe approaching from the southern beach. It was the one Dick had sent for the canoe builders, its paddle dipping into the calm waters of Karolin lagoon.

Dick's heart sank as he realized that danger lurked in every corner of this island and beyond. The world beyond his own was full of men who would stop at nothing to claim what they wanted.
